As a team, discuss your ideas and be prepared to answer the following questions that will need to be answered in the Initial  Project Information form:

What is your team's name?
definitely-not-malware

Does your team will need a web server to host your project?
Yes

Does your team will need a database server?
Yes

What is your team's "alternate dispute resolution" mechanism. This is what your team will do when it is unable to agree on a decision. This approach should be fast, simple, and as silly & fun as possible. (The silliness is a feature. It limits any bad feelings that the non-winning side may have.) VOTING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
Origami fortune teller.

Tinder for classes. 

Write 1 or 2 paragraphs describing how people would use your project once it is complete. (Developing estimates is very, very hard and takes years to do well. 
These descriptions are only to help your project manager understand your goals and prioritize the work to be done).

	Our project idea is to create a web app for users to be able to find people to switch classes with. 
	Ideally, people would create an account using their school email and upload their class schedule. 
	They would indicate a class that they're looking to fit into their schedule and a class/classes that 
	they're looking to drop. The platform should match them with another student who wants to drop (or switch) 
	from a class that matches both student's preferences. It should also rule out any possible switches that 
	conflict with either student's schedule. Once a match is found, the platform would simply alert each student 
	with the other student's contact information so they could perform the class switch with their school's add/drop interface. 
	Students can switch both recitations and whole lecture slots.  


Write 1 or 2 paragraphs describing the typical users of your project once the project is complete.

	The typical user of this project would be a student who wishes to switch a class that they're currently enrolled in for a different class 
	(either completely different or the same class with a different timeslot). Users who want to drop a class and give it to another person. Users will upload 
	their full schedule with classes they are willing to switch as well as a list of classes they would like. We will pair this user with corresponding students 
	(students looking to drop classes that the user wants). Once the user has been paired, we will open a dialogue between these students and if both the student ane the user accept the 
	trade, and autogenerated emails will be sent from both students to their corresponding advisors asking for the switch. At this point, the advisor
	and the students will follow up outside our website to confirm the switch.
